# Template Ideas

I am still investigating templating options for widgets. Adaptive Cards seems like a potential way this could be done in an open source way. Will consider other options too.

## Examples

* [**Content Feed**](/templates/login.ac.json) - Would populate with latest 5 items from valid JSONFeed.
* [**Login prompt**](/templates/login.ac.json) - Would have an action that routes back to the Service Worker and can be (optionally) customized using a "title" and "button" value.
